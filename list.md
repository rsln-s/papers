### Perspectives of quantum annealing: Methods and implementations

A great overview (not too much hype, sober and thoughtful) of state-of-the art on quantum annealing. Co-authored by William D Oliver of MIT. Especially interesting overview of qubit implementations and the challenges posed by each hardware implementation.
